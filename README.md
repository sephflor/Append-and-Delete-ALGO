# Append-and-Delete-ALGO.This solution checks if string s can be transformed into string t using exactly k operations (each operation can either delete the last character or append any character). It works by calculating the minimum operations needed based on the common prefix, then checking if the remaining operations can be used effectively through empty delete-append pairs.
